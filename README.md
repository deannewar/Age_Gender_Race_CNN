# Age, Gender, Race Prediction using CNN

This project was based on the UTKFace dataset which has more than 20,000 faces labelled with age, gender and race. 

## Description

The CNN models were trained using the GPU's of Google Colab. 

## Getting Started


### Installing

* Download the UTKFace dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new

### Executing program

* To run the GUI screen, download or clone this repo and navigate to the folder of this repo. Simply run ```python gui.py``` and a screen will pop up. It asks the user to upload a local file which has to be an image in JPEG form. Wait a little while and the predictions will appear on your screen.

## Final words
This was a very fun project to do and helped me to get a better understanding of CNNs and how to work with OpenCV. Since I am fairly new to this community, I would love to recieve feedback and tips!
